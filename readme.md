This simple app calls the DogAPI endoint that displays one random image of the user's specified breed (if available) by inserting the user's text into the URL. This app will strip out spaces and caps from the user's input so that there are no syntax errors with the URL. It will not autocorrect spelling errors, however. It does catch any 404 code responses and informs the user that either DogAPI doesn't have this breed or it is misspelled.
